    <h2>Topic Brainstorm</h2>

    <p>Idea #1: Visualizing Diversity in the Beauty Industry</p>
    <p>When brainstorming about diversity, I thought about how the beauty industry does not cater to people of color.
    While many makeup brands are currently expanding their shade ranges, the majority of products are still biased towards
  fair-skinned, pink-undertoned people. As a way to promote diveristy within the beauty world, I want to create an interactive
banner that compares how many darker shades are on the market vs. lighter shades. The interactive aspect could include a mouse click
or mouse hover over certain companies that do provide a wider shade range, and those that do not.</p>

<p> Idea #2: Spotlight on Diversity-Supportive Artists</p>
<p>There are many artists and designers that are all promoting diversity within their works. However, not all of their art is
  recognized due to having smaller platforms or not having proper social media marketing materials. As a way to spread support for
  diversity, specifically in the art world, I want to create a simple app that compiles all of the artists that create artwork in
  support of diversity. The intention is to not only inspire artists to think about diveristy in their own work, but also to promote and
  recognize artists and designers with a smaller platform. I will collect the data by doing extensive research on various portfolio
  platforms and keeping a list of these artists.</p>

  <p>Idea #3: Addressing Hollywood's Lack of Diversity</p>
  <p>It has been widely acknowledged that Hollywood shows and movies have always lacked in diversity. I plan to focus specifically on
    the lack of Asian actors and actresses in the media by creating an app that introduces the profiles of all the Asian actors/actresses
    in the industry. I also plan to visualize the data in a map, by showing the comparison between the ratio of white actors to people of
    color.</p>
