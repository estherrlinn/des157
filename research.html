    <h2>Background Research</h2>

    <p>When I began to research my topic on spotlighting diverse artists online, I first wanted to know whether online art communities are beneficial to the artists or not. In the article, “Online Art Community: The pros and cons of online art groups” written by Brian Sherwin, discusses the benefits and drawbacks of being a part of an online art community. The benefits of having an online art group include establishing a sense of community for those who do not have a physical or supportive one, a source of inspiration and feedback, opportunities for collaboration and larger projects, and an area for growth. On the other hand, online art communities tend to be very “pack oriented” and are not necessarily the most credible or reliable. The pack mentality is the idea that individuals who are not “regulars” or have not been a member for long are subject to more criticism and judgments about their knowledge about art. In addition, some art communities are also vulnerable to scammers, whom may offer fake opportunities to promote one’s art. Upon reading both sides, I realized that the issue of art communities as “not for everybody” is something that should be addressed within my design. I realized that it was imperative for me to focus on alleviating the drawbacks of art communities and emphasize the positives.

<p>After learning about the presence of online art communities, I decided to research further about how people are discovering others within these groups. In an article written by Robert Klara, Klara explains how many people nowadays, particularly millenials, are discovering more art through online apps such as Instagram and Pinterest rather than at museums. According to the article, nearly 23% of Americans find artwork that interests them on social media networks. This statistic is important for many artists because it shows that there are opportunities of business and income for artists. From this article, I learned that many people turn to social media for the purpose of either buying or selling art. This important feature not only allows artists to have another source of income, but also be discovered by other potential buyers. For my app design, it is imperative that I also include a purchase and selling feature for artists.</p>

<br>
<p>The last research I conducted was to see which online art communities, in specific, are artists deviating towards. I found an article written by Billy Garretsen on LinkedIn, in which he lists five reasons why ArtStation.com is his favorite online art community. He listed these five reasons as: an engaging discovery and browsing feature, media support, seamless desktop to mobile design, user-friendly layout, and the ability for personalization. While this was written from an artist’s standpoint, I realize that the attributes he listed were also crucial for attracting people to continue to use the website. I learned that apps or websites that are high-functioning, well-designed, and also user-friendly are key attributes that can “make or break” a certain website or application. Therefore, for our final project, I must keep in mind to focus on the interface and provided features of the app.</p>
