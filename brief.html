    <h2>Project Brief</h2>

    <h3>Topic Summary</h3>
    <p>Diversity is something that is extremely important and crucial within our society, particularly within the art community. With the help of interactive technologies and social media, people from all around the world can share their work and stories with one another. Artists are able to connect with others with similar interests and working styles, as well as have a source of inspiration from a diverse group of people. Having a space like our platform provides is extremely crucial for the growth of an artist, whether it is in their work, their community, or even for their own personal well-being.
    </p>

<br>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>Our target audience is specific to the underrepresented artists and designers who are seeking for an opportunity and a platform to grow, network, and have creative freedom and expression. The idea of bringing diversity to our website not only includes spotlighting underrepresented works of art, but also people of various backgrounds and identities. While our targeted audience is geared towards artists, people who are interested in joining an art community for any reason, such as to discover other artists or gain inspiration, are also welcome on our platform. </p>

<br>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Our website will specifically address a few goals that we intend to achieve to increase diversity within the online art community. One of the main goals is to provide an opportunity for artists to be discovered for their work, as well as for who they are. This will be achieved through our artist spotlight or feature on our landing page. This particular feature will showcase a specific artistâ€™s background, work, and their profile on the site. In line with this goal is our artist discovery feature, which is essentially a search engine for artists, works, and genres. This is an important aspect in not only encouraging the discovery of a diverse group of art and artists, but it also provides many opportunities for other people, such as recruiters and managers from companies, to discover and connect with these artists.</p>
<p>Another one of our goals is to provide a more interactive community for underrepresented artists. When it comes to encouraging diversity and awareness, a strong support system is necessary. The website will allow for people to follow each other or other artists, so that they will always stay connected with each other. In addition, a map will be provided so that it is possible to connect with artists in similar locations. This can open up many opportunities for collaboration, or to even create a more personal friendship.</p>
<br>

<h3>Communication Strategy</h3>
<p>Our communication strategy highly emphasizes the visual and aesthetic features. Since one of our key goals is engagement, our website will have features and themes that welcomes the viewer to navigate through our website. Features like this will be described below.</p>

<br>
<h3>Look and Feel</h3>
<p>Our platform will be designed as a website, with features that are mobile and disability friendly. In terms of design and layout, our platform will reflect current modern trends and aesthetics with its clean and concise text, well-designed icons, and support for various forms of media. Our website layout will be clear so that it is extremely user-friendly, inviting, and also easy for anyone to navigate.</p>
