    <p>In our first prototype, we drew the desktop interface of our website, which included the navigation, home page, discover page, community page, and the profile. Our designs were rough sketches of the approximate layouts and features for our website. The feedback we received for our first prototype was to make our design and intent clearer, and to reconsider the spotlight feature on our homepage. Taking this feedback, we created our second prototype, which was more specific to the task of creating a profile and discovering one's community. The steps outlined in our second prototype are as follows: visit the home page, click sign up button, fill out pop-up form, and customize one's profile by uploading images of one's work and profile picture. Once a profile is set up, the next task was to find a community, which could be accessed in the navigation under the "Community" tag. Once redirected to the community page, there will be a map that displays other artists near your location. From this prototype, we received some feedback regarding information collection (password and validation), clarity for uploading work, and a more immediate redirect to map.
