        <h2>About Cindy</h2>
        <p>I’m a third-year student double majoring in design and cognitive science (neuroscience) at the University of California, Davis. Born and raised in the Silicon Valley, I’ve always had an immense appreciation for the intersection between technology,
          science, and design. As cheesy as it sounds, I couldn’t escape my love for design even if I tried (and to be completely honest, I have tried!). Anyway, I have more than just one love for design! The most valuable things in my life aside from
          design (and cognitive science, of course) include learning by traveling to places all over the world, de-stressing by spending quality time with people I love and care for, and experimenting by involving myself in new experiences.</p>
