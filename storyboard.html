    <p>Learning outcomes: One thing that I learned from this exercise was how to pinpoint the important ideas that I want to convey about my final project app. I needed to be able to convey the issue, the product, and the outcome within 5 frames, which turned out to be harder than I thought. In the first storyboard, I focused on the issue or the reason why this app is needed. I didn't go into detail about how the app was actually going to work or look like. However, based on feedback, I learned that I needed to be more specific about the product and solution, because that was what really mattered. In addition, my storyboard needed to emphasize more on the diversity aspect of the project, since it is the prompt of the assignment. In my second iteration, I condensed the first three frames of my initial storyboard into one frame, and then focused on the interface and the outcome for the rest. The feedback I received was positive, and people could still tell what I was trying to convey with my product.</p>
